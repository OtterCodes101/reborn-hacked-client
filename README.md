# Example Typescript Eagler Reborn Plugin
this repo is a template to make creating larger plugins easier. Just do `npm i` in order to install dependencies, then `npm run build` to build into a single file located in the build folder. 
Typescript will complain about the plugin API not being defined, but will build anyway. Do not worry about this.
